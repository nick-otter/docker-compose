#  This Compose file defines two services, web and redis. The web service:
    # Uses an image thatâ€™s built from the Dockerfile in the current directory.
    # Forwards the exposed port 5000 on the container to port 5000 on the host machine. We use the default port for the Flask web server, 5000.
    # The redis service uses a public Redis image pulled from the Docker Hub registry.
